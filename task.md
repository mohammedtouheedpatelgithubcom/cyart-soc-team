Theoretical Knowledge
> 1. Alert Priority Levels
> What to Learn:

    Core Concepts:
        Priority Definitions: Understand severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low) based on impact (e.g., data breach, service disruption) and urgency (e.g., active exploitation). Example: Critical = ransomware encryption; High = unauthorized admin access.
        Assignment Criteria: Prioritize using asset criticality (e.g., production server vs. test VM), exploit likelihood (e.g., known CVE with public exploit), and business impact (e.g., financial loss). Example: CVSS score of 9.8 for Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) = Critical.
        Scoring Systems: Master CVSS for risk quantification and explore SOC tools like Splunk’s risk scoring for alert prioritization.
    Key Objectives: Develop skills to assess and prioritize alerts using standardized criteria for efficient SOC operations.
> How to Learn:

    Study CVSS using FIRST’s CVSS guide to understand base, temporal, and environmental metrics.
    Review NIST SP 800-61 for incident severity classification and prioritization workflows.
    Analyze a real-world case (e.g., Log4Shell prioritization in CISA’s alerts) to map CVSS scores to priority levels.

> 2. Incident Classification
> What to Learn:

    Core Concepts:
        Incident Categories: Classify incidents by type, such as malware, phishing, DDoS, insider threats, or data exfiltration. Example: Insider threat = unauthorized data export by employee.
        Taxonomy: Use frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK (e.g., T1566 - Phishing), ENISA Incident Taxonomy, and VERIS (Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing) for standardized labeling.
        Contextual Metadata: Enrich incidents with details like affected systems, timestamps, source IPs, and IOCs (e.g., malicious hash).
    Key Objectives: Build proficiency in categorizing, labeling, and enriching incidents to streamline investigations.
> How to Learn:

    Explore MITRE ATT&CK to map incidents to tactics and techniques.
    Study ENISA Incident Taxonomy and VERIS framework for classification standards.
    Review case studies (e.g., phishing campaigns via SANS Reading Room) to practice adding metadata.

> 3. Basic Incident Response
> What to Learn:

    Core Concepts:
        Incident Lifecycle: Understand phases: Preparation (e.g., playbooks), Identification (e.g., alert triage), Containment (e.g., isolate systems), Eradication (e.g., remove malware), Recovery (e.g., restore services), Lessons Learned (e.g., post-mortem).
        Procedures: Learn system isolation, evidence preservation (e.g., memory dumps, file hashing), communication protocols, and SOAR tools for automation (e.g., Splunk Phantom for workflow orchestration).
    Key Objectives: Master the incident response lifecycle and procedures to respond effectively to security events.
> How to Learn:

    Study NIST SP 800-61 Incident Handling Guide for lifecycle details.
    Use SANS Incident Handler’s Handbook for response templates and best practices.
    Explore Let’s Defend for simulated incident response scenarios and SOAR concepts.

> Practical Application
> 1. Alert Management Practice
> Activities:

    Tools: Google Sheets, Wazuh, TheHive.
    Tasks: Create an alert classification system, prioritize alerts, document response procedures, create incident tickets, and practice escalation.
> Enhanced Tasks:

    Alert Classification System: Create a Google Sheets table to map alerts to MITRE ATT&CK techniques:

| Alert ID | Type        | Priority | MITRE Tactic       |
|----------|-------------|----------|--------------------|
| 001      | Phishing    | High     | T1566             |

    Test with a mock alert (e.g., “Phishing Email: Suspicious Link”).
    Prioritize Alerts: Simulate alerts (e.g., “Critical: Log4Shell Exploit Detected” vs. “Low: Port Scan”) and score using CVSS in Google Sheets. Example: Log4Shell CVSS 9.8 = Critical.
    Dashboard Creation: In Wazuh, create a dashboard to visualize alert priorities (e.g., pie chart for Critical vs. High alerts).
    Incident Ticket: Draft a ticket in TheHive with fields:

Title: [Critical] Ransomware Detected on Server-X
Description: Indicators: [File: crypto_locker.exe], [IP: 192.168.1.50]
Priority: Critical
Assignee: SOC Analyst

    Escalation Role-Play: Draft a 100-word email to escalate a Critical alert to Tier 2, summarizing the incident and IOCs.

> 2. Response Documentation
> Activities:

    Tools: Google Docs, Draw.io.
    Tasks: Create incident response templates, document investigation steps, create checklists, and conduct a mock post-mortem.
> Enhanced Tasks:

    Incident Response Template: Use a SANS template in Google Docs to document a mock phishing incident:

1. Executive Summary
2. Timeline
3. Impact Analysis
4. Remediation Steps
5. Lessons Learned

    Investigation Steps: Log actions for a mock incident:

| Timestamp            | Action                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------|
| 2025-08-18 14:00:00 | Isolated endpoint          |
