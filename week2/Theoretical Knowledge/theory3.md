## 1. NIST SP 800-61 Incident Handling Guide: Lifecycle Details

The **NIST SP 800-61** guide is a comprehensive document that defines the standard lifecycle for managing cybersecurity incidents effectively. Its core lifecycle phases include:

- **Preparation:**  
  Establishes policies, roles, tools, and training before incidents occur, building organizational readiness to handle threats proactively.

- **Detection and Analysis:**  
  Detects security events through monitoring and analyzes alerts and indicators of compromise (IOCs), such as malicious IPs and file hashes, to confirm incidents promptly.

- **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery:**  
  Contains the incident by isolating affected systems or blocking malicious activity, eradicates root causes like malware or vulnerabilities, and recovers systems back to normal operations while ensuring no residual compromise.

- **Post-Incident Activity (Lessons Learned):**  
  Reviews the incident response process to improve future detection, response, and prevention strategies.

The guide also aligns these phases with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** functions—Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover—emphasizing a continuous improvement and risk management approach.

## 2. SANS Incident Handler’s Handbook: Response Templates and Best Practices

The **SANS Incident Handler’s Handbook** complements NIST guidance by offering practical templates and workflows widely used in security operations:

- **Incident Response Process:**  
  Details the phases of preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned with actionable steps.

- **Response Templates:**  
  Provides checklists for evidence collection, containment procedures, communication plans, and forensic commands to standardize and streamline response activities.

- **Communication Best Practices:**  
  Advises on internal/external notification protocols, defining escalation paths and controlling information flow during incidents.

- **Team Coordination:**  
  Emphasizes establishing trained and authorized response teams with clear roles for efficient incident management.

- **Post-Incident Reviews:**  
  Focuses on lessons learned exercises to refine IR policies and improve future handling.

This handbook is regarded as an operational manual to ensure consistent, effective incident response.

## 3. Let’s Defend: Simulated Incident Response Scenarios and SOAR Concepts

**Let’s Defend** is an interactive platform that provides hands-on training with realistic, simulated cyberattack scenarios paired with Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (**SOAR**) tool exercises:

- **Simulated Incidents:**  
  Practitioners respond to incidents such as phishing, ransomware, and insider threats, practicing detection, investigation, containment, and recovery.

- **SOAR Integration:**  
  Users learn to automate manual tasks like alert validation, evidence gathering, ticketing, and coordinated workflows through platforms like Splunk Phantom.

- **Skill Enhancement:**  
  The platform builds analyst confidence and efficiency by replicating pressures and complexities of real-world incident response.

- **Operational Improvement:**  
  Mastery of SOAR reduces response time and error rates while assuring compliance and repeatable action via documented playbooks.

This practical training augments theoretical knowledge from guides like NIST and SANS by preparing SOC teams for actual incident management.
